## Project Overview

Caesar's cipher takes a phrase and substitutes each character by shifting it up or down the alphabet by a given integer. If necessary, the shifting would wrap around back to the beginning or end of the alphabet.

This full stack project is built with `Angular 8` in the frontend and `Nest.js` in the backend.

## Directory Structure

### Server

- The `server` folder has all files corresponding to the Nest.js backend server.

### Client

- The `client` folder of the root directory has all files of the client.
